#### For a regular strictly convex polygon with:  
n edges (=n vertices)  
R circumradius  
interiorAngle=(n−2)⋅180n  
edgeLength,s=2⋅R⋅sin(πn)  
apothem,a=R⋅cos(πn)  
area=12⋅n⋅s⋅a  
perimeter=n⋅s  

Polygon:
accepts vertices and circumradius

Properties:  
edges  
vertices  
interior angle  
edge length  
apothem  
area  

perimeter that has these functionalities:  
implements equality (==) based on # vertices and circumradius 
implements > based on number of vertices only
